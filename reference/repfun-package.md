# repfun: Create TLFs using Functions Styled after SAS Macros

A clinical reporting toolkit of R functions that are written to mimic
the style of SAS reporting macros. The purpose is to generate TLFs
(tables, listings and figures) that support clinical research. This
package is well suited for firms who wish to transition from SAS to R
without changing their ways of working as it follows a traditional SAS
workflow. Invoke functions (instead of macros) to summarize data and
produce formatted reports. This package differs from others in that it
includes tools for both analyzing and reporting data.
