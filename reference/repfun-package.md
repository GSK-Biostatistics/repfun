# repfun: Create TLFs using R Functions Styled after SAS Macros

A clinical reporting toolkit of R functions that are written to mimic
the style of SAS reporting macros. The purpose is to generate TLFs
(tables, listings and figures) to support clinical trials. This package
is well suited for firms who wish to transition from SAS to R without
changing their ways of working.
