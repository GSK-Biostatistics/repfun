Description: A clinical reporting toolkit of R functions that are written to mimic the style of SAS reporting 
             macros.  The purpose is to generate TLFs (tables, listings and figures) to support clinical trials. 
             This package is well suited for firms who wish to transition from SAS to R without changing their
             ways of working.
